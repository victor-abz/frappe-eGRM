## üîÑ System Workflow

### Basic Issue Lifecycle

1. **Intake**: Citizen reports issue (via web, mobile, or field officer)
2. **Registration**: Issue is recorded with tracking code
3. **Assignment**: Issue is routed to appropriate department/officer
4. **Investigation**: Field officer investigates and documents findings
5. **Resolution**: Solution is implemented and documented
6. **Closure**: Citizen confirms satisfaction and issue is closed
7. **Follow-up**: Optional follow-up to ensure lasting resolution

### Escalation Process

Issues can be escalated when:
- Resolution takes longer than expected
- Citizen is not satisfied with initial response
- Issue requires higher-level authority
- Cross-departmental coordination is needed
