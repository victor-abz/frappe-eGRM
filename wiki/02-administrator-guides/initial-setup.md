# Initial System Setup

This guide walks you through setting up EGRM from scratch. Follow these steps in order to ensure proper system configuration.

## üéØ Setup Overview

The initial setup involves these main phases:
1. **Administrative Structure**: Create geographical hierarchy
2. **Project Creation**: Set up your first project
3. **Classification System**: Configure categories, types, and statuses
4. **User Setup**: Create accounts and assignments
5. **Validation**: Test the complete workflow

## ‚è±Ô∏è Estimated Time
- **Planning**: 2-4 hours
- **Configuration**: 4-8 hours  
- **Testing**: 2-4 hours
- **Total**: 1-2 days

## üìã Pre-Setup Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Administrator access to EGRM system
- [ ] List of administrative regions and hierarchy
- [ ] Project requirements and scope
- [ ] User list with roles and contact information
- [ ] Department structure and responsibilities
- [ ] Categories and types to be supported

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Administrative Structure

### Step 1.1: Create Administrative Level Types

**Purpose**: Define the hierarchy levels for your geographical structure.

1. **Navigate to GRM Administrative Level Type**
   - Go to: **Home ‚Üí EGRM ‚Üí GRM Administrative Level Type ‚Üí New**

2. **Create hierarchy levels in order** (from highest to lowest):

   **Country Level:**
   ```
   Level Name: Country
   Level Order: 1
   Project: [Leave empty for now - will link after project creation]
   ```

   **Province Level:**
   ```
   Level Name: Province
   Level Order: 2
   Project: [Leave empty for now]
   ```

   **District Level:**
   ```
   Level Name: District
   Level Order: 3
   Project: [Leave empty for now]
   ```

   **Sector Level:**
   ```
   Level Name: Sector
   Level Order: 4
   Project: [Leave empty for now]
   ```

   **Cell Level:**
   ```
   Level Name: Cell
   Level Order: 5
   Project: [Leave empty for now]
   ```

3. **Save each level** before creating the next

**üí° Tip**: You can customize level names to match your country's administrative structure (e.g., State, County, Municipality, etc.)

### Step 1.2: Verify Administrative Levels

1. **Check the list view**: Go to **GRM Administrative Level Type** list
2. **Verify order**: Levels should be listed in correct hierarchical order
3. **Test uniqueness**: Each level name should be unique

## üè¢ Phase 2: Project Creation

### Step 2.1: Create Your First Project

1. **Navigate to GRM Project**
   - Go to: **Home ‚Üí EGRM ‚Üí GRM Project ‚Üí New**

2. **Fill in project details:**
   ```
   Project Title: Rwanda National GRM 2025
   Project Code: RW-NGRM-2025
   Description: National Grievance and Redress Mechanism for Rwanda
   Start Date: [Today's date]
   End Date: [Project end date, if known]
   Is Active: ‚úÖ (checked)
   Default Language: English
   Auto Escalation Days: 30
   Enable Citizen Feedback: ‚úÖ (checked)
   ```

3. **Save the project**

**Important Notes**:
- **Project Code** must be unique and will be used for identification
- **Auto Escalation Days** determines when issues are automatically flagged for escalation
- **Enable Citizen Feedback** allows citizens to rate resolutions

### Step 2.2: Link Administrative Levels to Project

1. **Edit each Administrative Level Type**
2. **Set the Project field** to your newly created project
3. **Save each level**

## üåç Phase 3: Geographic Hierarchy

### Step 3.1: Create Country-Level Region

   Project: RW-NGRM-2025
   Location: [Optional - add GPS coordinates if desired]
   ```

3. **Save the region**

### Step 3.2: Create Provincial Regions

Create records for each province:

**Example - Kigali Province:**
```
Region Name: Kigali Province
Administrative Level: Province  
Parent Region: Rwanda
Project: RW-NGRM-2025
Location: [Optional GPS coordinates]
```

**Repeat for all provinces:**

Location: [Optional GPS coordinates]
```

**Continue the hierarchy** down to Sectors and Cells as needed for your coverage area.
